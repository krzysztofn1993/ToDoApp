# ToDoApp
ToDoApp written in PHP with MySQL db, also with some composer dependencies.

Still working on this project, but if you want check what is already done go to https://github.com/krzysztofn1993/ToDoApp/tree/develop
and clone it. Then go to directory and run composer install (you need composer installed before). If something is not working (especially
stylesheets not loading) try to set your server documentroot to "PATH:/ToDoApp/" and same for Directory.
If you are using xampp as me you can do this changes in httpd.conf.

// TODO
    - add logs to server
